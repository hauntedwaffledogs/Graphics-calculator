# Graphics-calculator
go into the directory where 'main.c' is and open it in a terminal.
use 'gcc main.c -o [file name] -lm to compile
do ./[file name] in the terminal to run the program
use gnuplot to plot the points
do 'gnugragh' then use"plot['outputname.txt']w l" to plot the graph

the git repo has to be installed under documents otherwise you will need to compile the code yourself
